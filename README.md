# cppext
A collection of C++ classes which are quite fundamental and thus considered inside ChimeraTK as an extension of C++. The classes might have different quality, some might be more experimental while others might be extensively tested.

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/mhier/future_queue/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/mhier/future_queue)

The following classes are packaged inside this library:

* future_queue (see [future_queue.md](future_queue.md))
